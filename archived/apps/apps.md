# Apps Docs

[Back to Software Docs](/docs/)

Here, you will find documentation about the software team's app development initiatives. Although the apps subteam was disbanded, it may be revived in the future if interest exists.

The apps subteam was responsible for developing applications to be utilized by the team for various tasks. This subteam primarily used JavaScript and Typescript to develop their apps. For more information on apps that have been developed, check out the repos for applications listed below.

## Applications

- [Propguard](https://github.com/MissouriMRR/propguard) is a Codecademy-style webapp that lets you create and learn from interactive coding tutorials. Client-side only, no servers needed except for hosting instances.

- [Paracord](https://github.com/MissouriMRR/paracord) is a cross-platform app designed to easily log flight sessions and collect useful information.
