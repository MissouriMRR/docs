# OpenCV

[Back to Vision Docs](/docs/vision/)

OpenCV is a Python library that implements many useful computer vision functions. These functions are built in C++. Since C++ is a compiled language, it is much faster than equivalent Python code. OpenCV allows us to use these fast functions in Python. The computer vision subteam utilizes OpenCV to develop algorithms that achieve competition goals.

OpenCV uses [NumPy](/docs/vision/numpy)'s ndarrays to store and process images efficiently.

Some examples of functions that OpenCV provides are grayscale and kmeans clustering.
