# NumPy

[Back to Vision Docs](https://missourimrr.github.io/docs/vision/)

OpenCV is a Python library that implements many useful computer vision functions. The computer vision subteam utilizes OpenCV to develop algorithms that achieve competition goals.

OpenCV uses [NumPy](https://missourimrr.github.io/docs/vision/numpy)'s ndarrays to store and process images efficiently.
