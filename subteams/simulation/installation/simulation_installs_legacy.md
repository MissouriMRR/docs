# Simulation Installations

[Back to Simulation Docs](/docs/simulation/)

There are several pieces of software needed to get up and running with the simulator. Go to the page corresponding to your system for installation instructions.

- [Pre-Configured Installation](/docs/simulation/install/pre-configured/easy/)
- [Installation for Windows](/docs/simulation/install/windows)
- [Installation for Linux](/docs/simulation/install/linux)
    - Mac users go here too
    - Windows is currently the only system that Simulation is known to function on

After you have completed the installations, you can proceed to [Flying the Drone with Code](/docs/simulation/flying/).
