There are several pieces of software needed to get up and running with the simulator. Go to the page corresponding to your system for installation instructions.

**NOTE: Currently our project only works on Windows, Linux has not been tested**

- [Installation for Linux(Legacy)](/docs/simulation/legacy/simulation_install_linux)
  - Mac users go here too

After you have completed the installations, you can proceed to [Flying the Drone with Code]().
