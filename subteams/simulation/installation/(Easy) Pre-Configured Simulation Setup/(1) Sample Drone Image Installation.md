# Pre-Configured Virtual Image Setup

In an effort to simplifiy setup and improve compatiability, we run our PX4 flight controller and flight code in a Linux virtual machine. 

## Installing Virtual Box and Sample Drone Image

1. First, install the correct Virtual Box application for your operating system. 
    - [Windows Download](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/7.0.20/VirtualBox-7.0.20-163906-Win.exe)
    - [Mac Download](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/7.0.20/VirtualBox-7.0.20-163906-OSX.dmg)
    - [Linux Download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)
 
2. After following the prompts to install Virtual Box, download the Sample Drone Linux image from the link below 

    - [Image Download (TODO)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

3. Next, import the downloaded .ova file into virtualbox. When configuring RAM and CPU usage keep in mind that the virtual machine will be sharing power with computationally intensive simulations. 
4. Login to the Linux virtual machine using the password "multirotor"
