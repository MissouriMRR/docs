# Flight Docs

[Back to Software Docs](/docs/)

Here you will find documentation and tutorials relating to the flight subteam, which is
responsible for tasks related to autonomous flight.

### Information and Setup

-   [Installation Guide](/docs/flight/installation_guide/)
-   [Asynchronous Information Page](/docs/flight/asynchronous/)
-   [QGroundControl Official Page](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/index.html)
-   [Mission Planner Official Page](https://ardupilot.org/planner/)
-   [DroneKit Example Code](https://dronekit.netlify.app/examples/index.html)

\
**_What technologies do we use?_**

The flight subteam utilizes the following:

-   ArduPilot
-   QGroundControl
-   Mission Planner
-   DroneKit

\
ArduPilot is the flight control software used for sending commands to the drone.

QGroundControl provides flight controls, mission capabilities, and an interactive overhead
view of the drone's environment.

Mission Planner is an alternative to QGroundControl that runs on Windows and works with
WSL.

DroneKit is the Python package we use to code.

\
**_How do I get started?_**

Read the [installation guide](/docs/flight/installation_guide/) and follow the
instructions to get your coding environment set up.
