# Flight Docs

[Back to Software Docs](/docs/)

Here you will find documentation and tutorials relating to the flight subteam, which is responsible for tasks related to autonomous flight.

\
***What technologies do we use?***

The flight subteam utilizes the following:
- PX4
- jMAVSim
- QGroundControl

PX4 is the flight control software used for sending commands to the drone.

jMAVSim is a simulator that allows you to fly drones around in a simulated world while running PX4.

QGroundControl provides flight controls, mission capabilities, and an interactive overhead view of the drone's environment.
