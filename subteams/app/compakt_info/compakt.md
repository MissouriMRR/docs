# Compakt

## Introduction

Compakt is a Typescript-based application used to record information from our flight days. Information regarding the involved parties, drones used during flight, and th eterrain present are recorded into a log and saved to our database. These logs can be exported to a .csv file for distribution.

### Accessing the Site

Compakt can be acccessed from [here](https://compakt.pages.dev).

Once you enter the site you will be prompted to enter an email. Use your @mst.edu email address for this verification. You will receive an email from Cloudflare with a one-time verification code.

Future work will be to restrict access to Multirotor Leads and approved users, so access the site while you can.

### Phone Numbers

Upon gaining access to the site, you will receive a pop-up promot you to call two phone numbers. If you are currently at a testing field, then be sure to call both numbers. If not, disregard.

### Pages

The first page on the Compakt site is the home page, displaying the Multirotor logo and general information regarding this application and its purpose. It is essentially a landing page, good for first-time users.

There are two tabs on the Compakt site, __Record__ and __Logs__.

## Recording Logs

When you click on the __Record__ tabs, you will be sent to the page for recoridng various flight information. An overivew of each parameter is detailed below:
