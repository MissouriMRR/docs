# App Docs

[Back to Software Docs](/docs/)

Here, you will find documentation about the software team's app development initiatives. The app subteam was recently revived as of November 2023 to work on the Compakt app, but have been working on projects since 2019 before being temporarily disbanded.

The apps subteam is responsible for developing applications to be utilized by the team for various tasks. This subteam primarily uses JavaScript and Typescript to develop their apps. For more information on apps that have been developed, check out the repos for applications listed below.

## Current Applications

- [Docs](https://github.com/MissouriMRR/docs) is this documentation website, which hosts all important info about each of software division's ongoing and past projects.

- [Compakt](https://github.com/MissouriMRR/compakt) is a mobile webapp used for tracking important flight day information in place of the physical flight operations document. It can be accessed [here](https://compakt.pages.dev/).

## Archived Applications

- [Propguard](https://github.com/MissouriMRR/propguard) is a Codecademy-style webapp that lets you create and learn from interactive coding tutorials. Client-side only, no servers needed except for hosting instances.

- [Paracord](https://github.com/MissouriMRR/paracord) is a cross-platform app designed to easily log flight sessions and collect useful information.

- [MultirotorGroundControl](https://github.com/MissouriMRR/Multirotor-Ground-Control) is a fork of the QGroundControl project with some little changes to the GUI to include Multirotor Design Team branding.
