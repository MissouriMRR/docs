# Virtual Machines

[Back to Docs](/docs/)

Virtual Machines allow you to run a virtual operating system on your host os. For example, if you have a Windows computer, you can create a Linux virtual machine, which would allow you to run a Linux desktop in a window. (very oversimplified)

It is recommended that you create, run, and test your code on Linux (usually Ubuntu). This is for a number of reasons, most importantly that Windows is often inconsistent and may require workarounds for certain tools/technologies to work correctly.

Below is a guide on creating an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine using VirtualBox on a Windows host machine. Ubuntu is a popular distribution (distro) of Linux and is very user-friendly. VirtualBox is a popular hypervisor (essentially a program that can create/run virtual machines).

## Downloads

To begin, you will need to download a couple of things:

- VirtualBox: [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- Ubuntu ISO image: [https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

## Installing VirtualBox

Once the installer for VirtualBox is downloaded, launch it and follow the prompts to install VirtualBox.

## Creating the Virtual Machine

1. Open VirtualBox
2. Click the "Add" button at the top
