# Git

[Back to Software Docs](https://missourimrr.github.io/docs/)

Git is a version management tool used by our team to keep track of code changes. Specifically, our repos are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/MissouriMRR). On our GitHub, you will find code for various projects and competitions.

Git is used to work collaboratively and keep track of changes to our code. Here you will find documentation and tutorials to help you better understand what Git is and how to use it.
