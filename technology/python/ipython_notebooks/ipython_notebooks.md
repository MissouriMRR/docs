# IPython Notebooks

[Back to Python](/docs/python/)


## IPython Notebooks (AKA Jupyter Notebooks)

[IPython Notebooks](https://ipython.org/notebook.html) are a special type of file that allows you to run Python code one block at a time. These notebooks allow you to store both Python code and its output in one file. The output of a block of code is stored in the file once it is run, so it is persistent and will remain when you close and open the file again.

IPython Notebooks can also contain [markdown formatting](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), allowing it to act like, well, a notebook. The notebooks store markdown-style text, code blocks, and code output. This makes them ideal for experimenting, learning, and debugging.

## Using IPython Notebooks

IPython Notebooks (aka Jupyter Notebooks) can be opened with several programs. The most prominent is the [Jupyter Notebook Interface](https://jupyter.org/). This is an interactive environment/editor that you can run locally. To check it out, you can view an online example notebook [here](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/). You can download the software using the instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

An alternative to Jupyter is to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). After installing the Python and Jupyter extensions from the built-in extension browser, you can edit and run IPython Notebooks directly from VS Code.

Once you create or open an IPython Notebook, you can execute code block-by-block. The keys to do this vary depending on the IDE you are using, so Google is your best friend.
