## Never Used Python?

There are quite a lot of resources for beginners in Python. Python is easy to learn and hard to master. Below are some good tutorials for if you have never used Python before. I recommend starting with the [W3Schools Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)

Alternatively, you can check out our [Intro Tutorial](/docs/python/intro/tutorial/).

For information on getting Python installed and setting up to work on Python code, check out [Setting up your Environment](/docs/python/set_up/)
